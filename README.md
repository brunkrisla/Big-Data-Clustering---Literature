# Big-Data-Clustering---Literature
Using Apache Mahout to cluster big data, and compare parameters: K and Distance measure (Euclidean and Cosine)

THis report contains:
Plot a graph that shows the relation between the average distance to the centroid and the K-value.

Try to smooth graph to explain the value for K as the best value such that beyond this value there wouldnâ€™t be any significant reduction in the average distance to centroid. 


Consider other distance measure of your choice and compare the different clusters you obtained in both the cases. Discuss what is the best setting for K-means clustering for this dataset.
