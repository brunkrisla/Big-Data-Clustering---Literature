# Big-Data-Clustering---Literature
Using Apache Mahout to cluster big data, and compare parameters: K and Distance measure (Euclidean and Cosine)

### Context 
The surge in growth of Big Data usage and popularity has resulted in challenging conditions for clustering datasets.The key challenge when implementing k-means clustering is maintaining commonality between the features across the clustered groups of data. Selecting the appropriate parameters based on the structure and nature of the data can improve the algorithm's performance.The number of clusters can impact how close together members of a cluster are and how dissimilar members of different clusters are. Similarly, the choice of distance measure is dependent on the nature and structure of the dataset.Evidently, testing and evaluating different parameters is an integral part of the evaluating a clustering algorithm.

- Comparisons between different distance measures and values of K in reagrds to inter and intra cluster denssity
